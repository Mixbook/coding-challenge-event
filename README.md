### What is the Coding Challenge?
The Coding Challenge is an event for developers, where you compete against each other to showcase your skills and crack a few technical problems. Each participant will be given a set of code riddles, which they will then have to solve using any approved programming language.

The winners will be the developers who cracked the largest number of problems in the fastest, most accurate, elegant or interesting way. The winners are selected by an expert jury of senior developers based on the criterias above.
Are you ready? Let's code!
